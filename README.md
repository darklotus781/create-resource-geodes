# Create: Resource Geodes
This is a Minecraft Mod for Forge 1.20.1
This mod adds Geodes underground in Ocean Biomes.  These Geodes contain Asurine, Crimsite, Ochrum and Veridium.
Geodes are wrapped in Coal Blocks and at the heart is a Catalyst block.  Using redstone dust on the block will generate more Ore Stones in an 11x11 cube around the Catalyst but only taking the place of Air blocks.
Automate these Geodes for infinite resources!

Geodes can be located using the Structure Compass mod or the `/locate structure` command.

### Why?
This mod was built to allow for infinite basic resources in packs that don't want Void miners, Chunk destroyers or RFTools Builders.

### Coming Soon
We're adding an item that when right clicked on the catalyst, will teleport it XX number of blocks (as defined in the mod config).
This is a vertical upwards movement only and only into an existing air block.
