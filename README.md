# Create: Resource Geodes
This is a Minecraft Mod for Forge 1.20.1
This mod adds Geodes underground in Ocean Biomes.  These Geodes contain Asurine, Crimsite, Ochrum and Veridium.  
Geodes are wrapped in Coal Blocks and at the heart is a Catalyst block.  Using redstone dust on the block will generate more Ore Stones in a Sphere around the Catalyst but only taking the place of Air blocks.  
The Sphere Radius and Fill Percentage are customizable in the configs.  
If Applied Energistics 2 is installed, you can opt to replace the Mysterious Cube with a Sky Stone Catalyst (also in the config) which will generate Sky Stone Blocks around the Catalyst.  
Automate these Geodes for infinite resources!

Geodes can be located using the Structure Compass mod or the `/locate structure` command.

Hidden away in Abandoned Mineshaft Loot Chests and in the Wandering Traders backpack, you'll find a Catalyst Activator Wand.  This tool is used to move the Catalyst in the direction you click the wand on the block and the distance is configured in the configs.
Be careful though, the wand does have durability and cannot be crafted without a custom recipe which you can add using KubeJS.

### Why?
This mod was built to allow for infinite basic resources in packs that don't want Void miners, Chunk destroyers or RFTools Builders.
